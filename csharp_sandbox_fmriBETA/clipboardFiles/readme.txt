
1. If call to run this program was click on:
   -- directory, then do recursive search like we've been doing
   -- file, then parse file into stub for search pattern and put dirname into textbox for dir to be searched

2. Two modes: (default is file search, other is folder search).

3. Drop down (menu or what control?) to list commonly used search expressions.

4. Ability to add current search to the "commonly used search expressions" [menu?]; saved in registry, XML or
what mechanism to preserve across sessions?
