There are important considerations and tradeoffs that come with converting
acceleration data into sound (vibrations) audible to humans. Perhaps the most
important consideration is the human hearing system and its limitations.

Wikipedia suggests that humans can hear sound in the frequency range (pass-band)
from about 20 to 20 kHz. Some humans likely have a narrower or truncated
pass-band.

Finally, an acknowledgement to my neighbors who may have heard a few strange
chirps and squeaks coming from my general direction during testing of this code.
