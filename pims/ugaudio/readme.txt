There are many important considerations and tradeoffs that come with converting
acceleration data into sound (vibrations) audible to humans. Perhaps the most
important consideration is the human hearing system and its limitations.

Some have said that humans can hear sound in the frequency range from about 20
to 20 kHz.  More likely, some humans have a narrower and/or offset pass-band.
