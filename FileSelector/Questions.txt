How best to glob: (1) regexp filter FileSelector output, (2) use Shell call with stream filtering?
-- for (1), try this: if glob pattern to match is this (no quotes): "c:\temp\sub*\file*.txt"
                                         then use this (no quotes): "c:\\temp\\sub[^\\]*\\file[^\\]*\.txt"
   the logic for this would be: [1] replace all backslash with double-backslash
